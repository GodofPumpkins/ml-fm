things to ask duy:
ask for advice on report format
ask later more about contents
how should I present my findings?
how should I present appendices/my code? online repository?

how should I do my demo day? what equipment should I request?





report writing:
fix margins etc in the title page


implementation:
maybe talk some more about fixing spiegelib or add in branch
talk about data pipeline
talk about cnn structure
talk about genetic algorithm structure

results:
put in conv6 results

genetic algo attack not being good enough
mayube this paper: https://www.proquest.com/openview/0a2fc9fe70e0b166ccc87eb741047bd6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y

put in GA results, should have 2op 4op 6op?

go in depth about a couple of the outputs idk, I have all those pretty spectrograms


conclusions/extensions:
make a point about envelopes being important with this source maybe
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342379402_Temporal_Envelope_for_Audio_Classification

talk about classifying sounds in nsynth for what fm is best at


mention having two frequency params - coarse and fine. does that mess up genetic algo?



appendices:
make branch/update github
more results

references:

coding:
still could be useful to do parallel processsing
create branch of spiegelib with my changes
	

conv nn - idk if I should do any more on it? I got the one shitty graph saying it sucks idk what else to do

maybe try changing hop length or frame size to get more finegrained analysis?
improve genetic algo?

fix some of the sounds, need to be pitch shifted up to have correct fundamental tone
maybe ask people to rate?




good quote: (have ethics section?)
I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that canâ€™t be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which. - Laurie Spiegel
