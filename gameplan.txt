todo:
start writing report



tonight - just let genetic algorithms do their things
maybe look into parallel processing so I can run multiple cells/dataset generators	
	

conv nn - generate stft dataset, hopefully won't take massively longer just because of larger size
check if tf is using gpu, make sure that is all setup for the love of god









I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that canâ€™t be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which. - Laurie Spiegel
