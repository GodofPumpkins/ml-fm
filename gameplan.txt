important



talk about classifying sounds in nsynth for what fm is best at

saxophone spectrum, could be good to talk about

appendices:
update spiegelib github branch
add more results, maybe mean/std dev for each model

coding:
create branch of spiegelib with my changes




good quote: (have ethics section?)
I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that canâ€™t be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which. - Laurie Spiegel




meeting notes
skip over lit review, not super important

abstract - background, reearch, methodo, results w numbres, impacts and meanings

include list of figures/figures
list of acronyms

theory and principles - replace with propsed methodology


compare to existing methods/be fair

include lots of results

rationale hehind results


results - tell a story

organise into groups of 10 of so

appendix - don't include too much, more in text



demo day
2 examiners
more than 10 percent difference, then deliberate


be positive, justify failures

what would I ask??

zhiyong cheng and andrew fleming

zhiyong control/ml, andrew fm and music, not expert in ml



make them understand porblem, my problem isn't sraightforward





what code snippets do I want to include? would definitely help bulk up paper and should be useful. should transfer final result to single file
