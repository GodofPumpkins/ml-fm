email lab people for speakers, specify I need space for keyboard


report writing:
fix margins etc in the title page


implementation:
maybe talk some more about fixing spiegelib or add in branch
talk about data pipeline
talk about cnn structure
talk about genetic algorithm structure

results:
put in conv6 results

genetic algo attack not being good enough
mayube this paper: https://www.proquest.com/openview/0a2fc9fe70e0b166ccc87eb741047bd6/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y
try using algorithm 5


put in GA results, should have 2op 4op 6op?

go in depth about a couple of the outputs idk, I have all those pretty spectrograms


conclusions/extensions:
make a point about envelopes being important with this source maybe
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342379402_Temporal_Envelope_for_Audio_Classification

talk about classifying sounds in nsynth for what fm is best at


mention having two frequency params - coarse and fine. does that mess up genetic algo?



appendices:
make branch/update github
more results

references:
spiegelib

coding:
still could be useful to do parallel processsing
create branch of spiegelib with my changes
	

conv nn - idk if I should do any more on it? I got the one shitty graph saying it sucks idk what else to do

maybe try changing hop length or frame size to get more finegrained analysis?
improve genetic algo?

fix some of the sounds, need to be pitch shifted up to have correct fundamental tone
maybe ask people to rate?




good quote: (have ethics section?)
I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that canâ€™t be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which. - Laurie Spiegel




meeting notes
skip over lit review, not super important

abstract - background, reearch, methodo, results w numbres, impacts and meanings

include list of figures/figures
list of acronyms

theory and principles - replace with propsed methodology


compare to existing methods/be fair

include lots of results

rationale hehind results


results - tell a story

organise into groups of 10 of so

appendix - don't include too much, more in text



demo day
2 examiners
more than 10 percent difference, then deliberate


be positive, justify failures

what would I ask??

zhiyong cheng and andrew fleming

zhiyong control/ml, andrew fm and music, not expert in ml



make them understand porblem, my problem isn't sraightforward
